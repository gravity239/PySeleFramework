1. On the machine that acts as local windows Allure Report server, install Allure commandline application following
the instructions as https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_windows

2. On client machines, they should map a network drive to the folder that stores all generated report files from Allure plugin. After that,
pass this path to the argument "--alluredir=$path" when running tests. For e.x: $path = "Z:\AllureResults"

3. On the server, open command line windows and run: allure open "C:\Users\long.do\AppData\Local\Temp\1696678230558166184\allure-report" -p 2309
This command will start a web server for the allure report in the above folder at port 2309. You can change to any port you want

4. On the server, create a power script (.PS1) that helps monitor $path as mentioned in step 2. This script
will auto generate the new report to the folder in step 2 each 30s if there are any changes in the $path. Right-click on
the script and Run with powershell

### SET FOLDER TO WATCH + FILES TO WATCH + SUBFOLDERS YES/NO
    $watcher = New-Object System.IO.FileSystemWatcher
    $watcher.Path = "Z:\AllureResults"
    $watcher.Filter = "*.*"
    $watcher.IncludeSubdirectories = $true
    $watcher.EnableRaisingEvents = $true

### DEFINE ACTIONS AFTER AN EVENT IS DETECTED
    $action = { $path = $Event.SourceEventArgs.FullPath
                $changeType = $Event.SourceEventArgs.ChangeType
                $logline = "$(Get-Date), $changeType, $path"
                Add-content "D:\allure_log.txt" -value $logline
                cmd.exe /c allure generate "Z:\AllureResults" --output "C:\Users\long.do\AppData\Local\Temp\1696678230558166184\allure-report" --clean
              }
### DECIDE WHICH EVENTS SHOULD BE WATCHED
    Register-ObjectEvent $watcher "Created" -Action $action
    Register-ObjectEvent $watcher "Changed" -Action $action
    Register-ObjectEvent $watcher "Deleted" -Action $action
    Register-ObjectEvent $watcher "Renamed" -Action $action
    while ($true) {sleep 30}

5. After running tests from any machines, we just need to navigate to the web server in step 3 to check the test report.

**Note that: This solution may not be reliable when machines running tests at a same time.
